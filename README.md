# monokai-easy-retina-syntax theme

This theme was inspired by Marian Zagoruiko's [Monokai - Easy White for Retina Theme](http://colorsublime.com/theme/MonokaiEasyForRetina) and by Kevin Sawicki [Monokai Atom Theme](https://github.com/kevinsawicki/monokai). This theme is an extension of the Atom Monokai theme. Some additonal classes were added, but the main changes implemented were simply color enhancements.

**Note**: If working on an application that uses Handlebars, it is best to use the [Handlebars](https://atom.io/packages/Handlebars) atom package for stylistic purposes.

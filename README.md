# monokai-easy-retina-syntax theme

This theme was inspired by Marian Zagoruiko's [Monokai - Easy White for Retina Theme](http://colorsublime.com/theme/MonokaiEasyForRetina) and by Kevin Sawicki [Monokai Atom Theme](https://github.com/kevinsawicki/monokai). This theme is an extension of the Atom Monokai theme. Some additonal classes were added, but the main changes implemented were simply color enhancements.

The theme has only been tested for JavaScript, Handlebars, HTML, SCSS, Python, and JSON files.

*Note*: If working on an application that uses Handlebars, it is best to use the [Handlebars](https://atom.io/packages/Handlebars) atom package for stylistic purposes.
